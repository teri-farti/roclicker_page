## Roclicker

​This project is a 2D clicker game developed within a single day using the Godot Engine 4.5.1. It explores the intersection of incremental mechanics and environmental storytelling through visual degradation.
-----

## ​Overview

​The game begins in a dark, minimalist environment. As the player gathers resources from a central monolith and acquires upgrades, the game's atmosphere undergoes a fundamental shift. High-value "Solar Stones" accelerate progress but introduce radiation, which gradually increases the game's brightness and visual intensity, leading to a critical systemic collapse.
-----

## ​Core Features

​Dynamic Visual Evolution: Real-time environment manipulation using WorldEnvironment (Glow and Brightness adjustments) based on radiation levels.
​Responsive UI/UX: Implemented "juice" mechanics, including screen shake, dynamic font scaling, and UI vibration synchronized with resource acquisition.
​Economy System: 20 distinct upgrade tiers with exponential scaling to balance progression difficulty.
-----

## Endings

A final decision-making mechanic where the player must choose between systemic preservation or total radiation-induced collapse.
​Multi-Platform Support: Fully compatible with Android, Windows, and Linux.
​Audio Integration: Contextual sound effects for clicking, purchasing, and solar events.
-----

## ​Project Status

​Completed: Core loop, 20-tier upgrade system, radiation-based visual scaling, audio system, and final choice mechanics.
​Future Considerations: Narrative expansion and procedural background shaders were excluded due to the one-day development constraint.
-----

## ​Technical Specifications

​Engine: Godot 4.5.1
​Language: GDScript
​Rendering: Mobile (optimized for Android performance)
​Input: Multi-touch support for mobile and mouse-click support for desktop.
-----

## ​Installation

​To play the game, follow these steps:
​Download the binary file corresponding to your operating system (Android, Windows, or Linux) from the Releases section.
​Install the file on your device (for Android, ensure "Install from Unknown Sources" is enabled if installing via APK).
​Launch the executable.
